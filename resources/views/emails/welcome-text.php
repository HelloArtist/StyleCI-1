Dear <?php echo e($name); ?>,

Thank you for creating an account on StyleCI; we're excited to have you on board!
StyleCI is powered by PHP CS Fixer, and is totally configurable via an optional .styleci.yml file which can be committed to your repo. You can read all about this over on our blog: https://blog.styleci.io/redefining-configuration.
It might be useful for you to check out PHP CS Fixer's documentation before continuing at https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer regarding what each fixer actually does.
If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach out to us by emailing support@cachet.io, or by creating a new issue on GitHub at https://github.com/StyleCI/StyleCI/issues/new.

Thank you,
StyleCI
